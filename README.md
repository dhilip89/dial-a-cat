# How to use dial-a-cat

Before you can start “dialing” cat pictures, you’ll need the following:

* A telephone with good audio quality.
  (If your cell-phone doesn’t work, try a hardwired phone)
* One of the following:
  * A computer running Linux, OS X, or Windows
  * An iPhone or Android phone
* [SSTV software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television#External_links) capable of decoding Martin M2 transmissions
  * Linux - [qsstv](http://users.telenet.be/on4qz/)
    (Ubuntu users should [use this PPA](http://askubuntu.com/questions/4983/what-are-ppas-and-how-do-i-use-them): “ppa:kamalmostafa/qsstv”)
  * OS X - [MultiScan 2SL](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jf-files/MultiScan_2SL.zip)

* When you hear “standby”, hold the speaker of your phone up to the microphone of the device running the SSTV decoding software.
* Wait for your cat picture to show up.

What to do after you’ve seen all of the pre-rendered images:

* Press the “8” at any time while you’re connected to dial-a-cat.
* A cat picture will be selected Just For You using The Cat API.
* This image will be rendered into an SSTV transmission for you on-the-fly.
